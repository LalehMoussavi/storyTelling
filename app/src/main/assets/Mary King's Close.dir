 On the other side of the street you can see the Parliament Square. It is said that this is where the devil appeared in 1513, reading out a list of those who would die in the disastrous Battle of Flodden - including King James IV. Now head down the hill and our next haunted stop would be the Bell's Wynd, about 200 meters from here,located in the Mid-High Street.
