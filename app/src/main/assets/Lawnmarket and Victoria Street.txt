Just off Lawnmarket is Victoria Street, which has a very dark past. Top villain is ‘The Wizard of the West Bow’, Major Thomas Weir, executed for witchcraft in 1670. Weir's house, reputed to be the most haunted in Scotland, was discovered to be part of the Quaker Meeting house on Victoria Terrace. A phantom coach, pulled by headless horses and ridden by the devil himself, gallops down the street late at night — presumably giving the ghost of Major Weir a lift. A sailor named Angus Roy, crippled on a voyage in 1820, is also seen dragging his leg. Shame he picked such a steep street to hang out. Brodie’s Close on Lawnmarket is, quite naturally, haunted by the notorious baddie Deacon Brodie - inspiration for Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Round the corner, in vaults under George IV Bridge (once used as a prison), lurks an unidentiﬁed highland chief in manacles.
