This one is not strictly a haunting, but worth including. Charles Dickens visited Canongate Kirkyard and saw a headstone which he thought read Ebenezer Scroggie: Mean man. In fact, the stone belonged to a corn dealer and said Ebenezer Scroggie: Meal man. Blissfully unaware of this, Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, giving us the superb villain Ebenezer Scrooge and a classic supernatural trio in the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. The Tolbooth pub has poltergeist that moves things around and Chesselâ€™s Court is haunted by a woman wearing a black silk veil, who hanged herself in the 19th century. Queensberry House boasts a phantom kitchen boy, roasted and eaten by the mad son of the Marquess of Queensberry. Apparently he tasted of chicken.The last on may have been made up a bit.
