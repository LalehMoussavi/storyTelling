Our first stop is Edinburgh Castle at the top of the mile. You can stand outside and admire it's tearing walls (so many attackers have done) or you can pay the rather considerable entrance fee and explore the place. It is worth it though because the castle is amongst the Edinburgh's must visit sites, containing such treasures as: the Scottish Crown Jewels, the giant Mons Meg, a splendid War Memorial and Edinburgh's oldest building, the 12th century St Margaret's Chapel.
