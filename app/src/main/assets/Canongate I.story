Three very different spirits stalk the Canongate. The ﬁrst is ‘Daft Jamie’ Wilson, a simpleton killed by William Burke and William Hare (they murdered another, Mary Paterson, who haunts Gullan’s Close). Altogether Burke and Hare suffocated sixteen people, selling the bodies to Dr Robert Knox at Edinburgh University’s Anatomy department for his students to dissect. The second is a hooded ﬁgure, who may be the 17 th century minister and wife killer, John Kello. Then there’s a burning woman, daughter of a well to do family, who got pregnant by a servant and was killed in an 'accidental' ﬁle. On the balcony of Moray House the Covenanter leader the Marquess of Argyll spat on his arch enemy, the Marguess of Montrose as he was being led to his execution. Argle suffered the same fate shortly afterwards.
