Bell’s Wynd is haunted by a Mrs Guthrie. Murdered by her husband for having an affair, her body remained undiscovered in a locked room for two decades. In Europe's most overcrowded street. Hmmmm. Phantom drumming can be heard under the Tron Kirk and the Scotsman Hotel (formerly Scotsman Newspaper) on the North Bridge had a bunch of ghosts, though they aren't often seen these days. Either you can't believe everything you read in the press or the present hotel is too expensive for them. The haunted Radisson Blu Hotel, built over the house of George Mackenzie, was damaged in one of the area’s many ﬁres, with the roof burning off in 1987. According to legend, John Spottiswood, Bishop of St Andrews (1565-1639) haunts the Mitre Bar. This seems like a very sensible place to spend eternity.
