Tyrannical Cardinal David Beaton and debauched Lord Darnley, husband of Mary Queen of Scots are amongst the Blackfriars Street's rather impressive ghosts. In 1567, Darnley was chased and strangled by assassins and now his frantic footsteps can be heard at night. According to folklore, a group of children were locked inside a local nursery after one was discovered to have plague symptoms. The indignant mothers ran down the Mile and forced their way past the guards - so they were locked in too. The sound of children crying can now be heard in the Museum of Childhood, which is already creepy enough, as it’s ﬁlled with Victorian dolls. The World’s End Bar was the site of an infamous double homicide in 1977 and St Mary’s Street is haunted by a young woman, murdered in 1916.
