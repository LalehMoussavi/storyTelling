According to legend, plague broke out in 1645 and the infected inhabitants were walled up inside. It's a chilling story but, happily, not true. The residents were actually quarantined outside the city and the close was inhabited until the last resident left in 1904. The lower half of the Close was eventually demolished, but the upper half was covered over and is now a spectacular underground visitor attraction. It got its creepy reputation because of a 1685 bestseller by Professor George Sinclair called Satan's Invisible World, which described the close as a supernatural hotbed. Haunted these days by a little girl called Annie. Visitors bring her dolls and now there's a whole room full of them. This is either touching or immensely creepy, depending on how much you like dolls and kids.
