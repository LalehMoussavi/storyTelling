According to legend, plague broke out in 1645 and the infected inhabitants were walled up inside. It's a chilling story but, happily, not true. The residents were actually quarantined outside the city and the close was inhabited until the last resident left in 1904. The lower half of the Close was eventually demolished, but the upper half was covered over and is now a spectacular underground visitor attraction. It got its creepy reputation because of a 1685 bestseller by Professor George Sinclair called Satan's Invisible World, which described the close as a supernatural hotbed. Haunted these days by a little girl called Annie. Visitors bring her dolls and now there's a whole room full of them. This is either touching or immensely creepy, depending on how much you like dolls and kids. Accross the street from the Mary King's Close, you will see the Parliament Square. This is Upper High Street and was where the devil appeared in 1513, reading out a list of those who would die in the disastrous Battle of Flodden - including King James IV. The writer Daniel Defoe, who worked for a time in Old Fishmarket Close, was rumored to have been an English secret agent during the 1707 Treaty of Union. The close was then home to the city hangman or 'Doomster', the last being John High, who died in 1817. Another famous 19th century resident was Maggie Dixon, tried under the Concealment of Pregnancy Act for abandoning her new born baby. After waking up from a failed hanging, she lived to old age and opened her own pub. Continue on royal mile down the hill. Shortly after crossing the intersect of South and North bridge, you will enter the Mid_High Street.
