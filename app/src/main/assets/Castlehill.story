The sounds of a phantom army can sometimes be heard marching along the esplanade towards the castle. Or perhaps it's the guy next to you eating crisps! At the bottom of the esplanade is a plaque and well, commemorating the spot where over 300 innocent women were burned as witches. In the area around Ramsay Garden you can sometimes see a hunchback in 18th century dress, dragging a wooden trunk. Further down Castlehill, the Whisky Heritage Centre has the ghost of a former master blender, which gives you a chance to experience a different kind of spirit. Sorry, couldn't resist that. The next door Witchery Restaurant’s name says it all really. Filled with Gothic ﬁnery it is haunted, unsurprisingly, by one of the women burned as a witch on Castlehill.
