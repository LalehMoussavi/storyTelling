In the shadow of Arthur's Seat (where seventeen tiny cofﬁns were discovered in 1836) is Holyrood. In 1128, King David I spotted a ghostly cross (or rood) between the antlers of a stag he was hunting, inspiring him to found Holyrood Abbey. Next came the Palace which, naturally, has an excellent class of ghost. It is supposedly haunted by Mary Queen of Scots and her husband Lord Darnley — which is a shame as they couldn’t stand each other. The ghost of Mary’s secretary, David Rizzio, who was stabbed to death by Darnley in front of the queen, also pops up. Some palace guides maintain the stain from his blood can still be seen on the ﬂoorboards, which is no mean feat, as they've been replaced more than once. Lowering the tone is the naked ghost of Bald Agnes, executed for witchcraft in 1592.
