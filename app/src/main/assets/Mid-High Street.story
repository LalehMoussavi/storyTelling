Bell’s Wynd is haunted by a Mrs Guthrie. Murdered by her husband for having an affair, her body remained undiscovered in a locked room for two decades, in Europe's most overcrowded street. Hmmmm. In the 19th century a secret tunnels was found in the dungeons of Edinburgh Castle. It was too small to accommodate an adult, so the town council sent in a drummer boy and follow the sound down the mile until it stopped under the Kirk. Figuring it was a lost cause, they sealed out the tunnel and now drumming can be head under the building. Also, the Scotsman Hotel on the North Bridge had a bunch of ghosts, though they aren't often seen these days. Either you can't believe everything you read in the press or the present hotel is too expensive for them. The haunted Radisson Blu Hotel, built over the house of George Mackenzie, was damaged in one of the area’s many ﬁres, with the roof burning off in 1987.  According to legend, John Spottiswood, Bishop of St Andrews (1565-1639) haunts the Mitre Bar. This seems like a very sensible place to spend eternity.
