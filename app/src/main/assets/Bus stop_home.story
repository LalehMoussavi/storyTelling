The castle is haunted by Lady Janet Douglas, burned as a witch in 1537, on the trumped up charge of trying to assassinate James IV. The ghost of John Graham of Claverhouse first appeared in 1689 after he was killed at the Battle of Killiekrankie. The dungeons are haunted by former prisoners of war, especially one who hid in a barrow of dung, hoping to be carried outside. He was tipped over the side of the ramparts instead and now tries to push unsuspecting tourists off in revenge. Hasn't managed yet, but you might be the first. Then there's an invisible drummer who only plays when the castle is about to be attacked. So if you hear him, start running. And look out for a phantom piper and a spooky steward, murdered by the castle governor in the 17th century. Some staff are just impossible to get rid of.
