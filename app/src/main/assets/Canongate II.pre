The canongate Tolbooth built in 1591, became a prison were many Covenanters were incarcerated. The scourge of those Covenanters, John Graham of Claverhouse, stayed here on his visits to Edinburgh. Which must have made the inmates even more uneasy. The building now houses the tolbooth tower which has a resident poltergeist who moves things around in the Bar area.
