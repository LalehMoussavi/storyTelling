Walk a few yards further and you'll come to the gothic spire of the Hub, headquarters of the Edinburgh International Festival. This is where Castlehill ends and lawnmarket begins. Cross over the roundabout and take a quick detour down the upper Bow to find yourself on a balcony overlooking Victoria Street. This was once the West Bow and is Notorious for supernatural sightings and dark deeds. Now follow the route on the map to go to the next stop.
